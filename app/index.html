        It should be illegal to collect and permanently store most kinds of behavioral data.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the United States, they warn us the world will end if someone tries to regulate the Internet. But the net itself was born of a fairly good regulatory framework that made sure de facto net neutrality existed for decades, paid for basic research into protocols and software, cleared the way for business use of the internet, and encouraged the growth of the commercial web.
      </p>
      <img src="images/bt14.062.jpg" alt="Old toy box with text on it: save harmless giant atomic bomb." />
      <p>
        It's good regulation, not lack of regulation, that kept the web healthy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here's one idea for where to begin:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Limit what kind of behavioral data websites can store. When I say behavioral data, I mean the kinds of things computers notice about you in passing—your search history, what you click on, what cell tower you're using.
        It's very important that we regulate this at the database, not at the point of collection. People will always find creative ways to collect the data, and we shouldn't limit people's ability to do neat things with our data on the fly. But there should be strict limits on what you can save.</li>
        <li>Limit how long they can keep it. Maybe three months, six months, three years. I don't really care, as long as it's not fifty years, or forever. Make the time scale for deleting behavioral data similar to the half-life of a typical Internet business.</li>
        <li>Limit what they can share with third parties. This limit should also apply in the event of bankruptcy, or acquisition. Make people's data non-transferable without their consent.
          <img src="images/bt14.063.jpg" alt="Photo of a young otter." />
        </li>
        <li>Enforce the right to download. If a website collects information about me, I should be allowed to see it. The EU already mandates this to some extent, but it's not evenly enforced.</li>
        <li>This rule is a little sneaky, because it will require backend changes on many sites. Personal data can pile up in all kinds of dark corners in your system if you're not concerned about protecting it. But it's a good rule, and easy to explain. You collect data about me? I get to see it.</li>
        <li>Enforce the right to delete. I should be able to delete my account and leave no trace in your system, modulo some reasonable allowance for backups.
          <img src="images/bt14.064.jpg" alt="Photo of a white mouse holding a teddy bear." />
        </li>
        <li>Give privacy policies teeth. Right now, privacy policies and terms of service can change at any time. They have no legal standing. For example, I would like to promise my users that I'll never run ads on my site and give that promise legal weight. That would be good marketing for me. Let's create a mechanism that allow this.</li>
        <li>Let users opt-in if a site wants to make exceptions to these rules. If today's targeted advertising is so great, you should be able to persuade me to sign up for it. Persuade me! Convince me! Seduce me! You're supposed to be a master advertiser, for Christ's sake!</li>
        <li>Make the protections apply to everyone, not just people in the same jurisdiction as the regulated site. It shouldn't matter what country someone is visiting your site from. Keep it a world-wide web.</li>
      </ol>
      <h2>Decentralize</h2>
      <p>
        I was very taken with <a href="https://twitter.com/bastianallgeier" target="_blank">Bastian Allgeier's</a> <a href="http://2014.beyondtellerrand.com/schedule/day:monday#bastian-allgeier" target="_blank">talk</a> yesterday on decentralization. And we'll be discussing a lot of these issues at <a href="http://decentralizecamp.com/" target="_blank">Decentralize Camp</a> tomorrow. Folklore has it that the Internet was designed to survive a nuclear war. Bombs could take out lots of nodes, but the net would survive and route around the damage. I think this remains a valuable idea, though we never quite got there. A good guiding principle is that no one company, or one country, should have the ability to damage the Internet, even if it begins to act maliciously.
      </p>
      <img src="images/bt14.066.jpg" alt="Painting of a kraken." />
      <p>
        We have a broad consensus on the need to decentralize the web; the question is how to do it. In this respect, I think even a little decentralization goes a long way. Consider how much better it is to have four major browser vendors, compared to the days of Internet Explorer. Some kinds of services are just crying out for decentralization. Fifty years from now, people will be shocked that we had one social network that all seven billion people on the planet were expected to join.
      </p>
      <p>
        Imagine if there was only one bar in Düsseldorf, or all of Germany, and if you wanted to hang out with your friends, you had to go there. And when you did, there were cameras everywhere, and microphones, and you were constantly being interrupted by people selling you stuff. That's the situation that obtains with Facebook today.
      </p>
      <p>
        Surveillance as a business model is the only thing that makes a site like Facebook possible.
      </p>
      <h2>De-Americanize</h2>
      <p>
        I have always wanted to have a ‚Death to America!' slide. Maybe I should just say ‚de-americanize'. As a naturalized US citizen, whose citizenship can potentially be revoked by court order, let me just say America is the greatest country on Earth, and I am lucky to live there. I am sorry that you can't live there too.
      </p>
      <p>
        In fact, we're so great that we can probably spare one or two of these giant websites and let you replace them with something based here in Europe. In the past year, you've seen that there is not a lot of concern in America for the privacy rights of the average German citizen. I think ‚zero' would be a fair number to put on that.
      </p>

      <p>
        If your prime minister can't get us to stop bugging her phone, how secure do you think your own data is, when you send it to California?
      </p>
      <p>
        And speaking of California, let me try another tack.
      </p>
      <p>
        This festive map shows seismic hazard in Northern California, where pretty much all the large Internet companies are based, along with a zillion startups. The ones that aren't here have their headquarters in an even deadlier zone up in Cascadia.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now of course, each company has four zillion datacenters, backed up across the world. But how much will that matter when there's a major quake, and Silicon Valley can't get to work for a month? All of these headquarters are going to be shut down for a long time when the Big One comes. You're going to notice it.
      </p>

      <p>
        So even if you don't agree with my politics, maybe you'll agree with my geology. Let's not build a vast, distributed global network only to put everything in one place!
        I'm tired of being scared of what the web is going go look like tomorrow.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yesterday, during <a href="https://twitter.com/USA2DAY" target="_blank">Robin's</a> <a href="http://2014.beyondtellerrand.com/schedule/day:monday#robin-christopherson" target="_blank">incredible talk</a>, I realized how long it had been since I looked at a new technology with wonder, instead of an automatic feeling of dread.
      </p>
      <p>
        [Robin Christiansen gave a profoundly moving talk about the ways in which smartphones, image recognition, wearable computers and other technologies are changing the lives of disabled people. Robin, who is blind, gave live demos of the apps and technologies he uses to better navigate the world, showing the extent to which they've restored his autonomy.]
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the worst aspects of surveillance is how it limits our ability to be creative with technology. It's like a tax we all have to pay on innovation. We can't have cool things, because they're too potentially invasive.
      </p>
      <img src="images/bt14.070.jpg" alt="Photo of a young elefant unter a waterfall." />
      <p>
        Imagine if we didn't have to worry about privacy, if we had strong guarantees that our inventions wouldn't immediately be used against us. Robin gave us a glimpse into that world, and it's a glimpse into what made computers so irresistible in the first place.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have no idea how to fix it. I'm hoping you'll tell me how to fix it. But we should do something to fix it. We can try a hundred different things. You people are designers; treat it as a design problem! How do we change this industry to make it wonderful again? How do we build an Internet we're not ashamed of?
